# ExportAll.jl

Provides a simple macro that exports all symbol of a module (export *). Use at your own risk WIP PL:s and issues are very much welcome :)

It basically works by exporting all symbols that are not imported from the module from which it is called or symbols defined in any of the standard modules. I use it myself for some library modules where I need to export all functions
